# 3D Rubik's-Cube-in-OpenGL

* Worked on project for the course of Computer Graphics to demonstrate contemporary techniques used in Computer Graphics such as texture mapping and ray tracing to simulate Rubik’s Cube
* Researched on different problems with Euler angles for rotation and how to avoid these problems by using Quaternions
* Presented final project findings to an audience of more than thirty people, project ranked among the top five

Controls: 
		‘p’: Top clockwise rotation
		‘P’ (Shift + ‘p’): Top anti-clockwise rotation

		‘O’ (Shift + ‘o’): Bottom  anti-clockwise rotation


		‘g’: Front clockwise rotation
		‘G’ (Shift + ‘g’): Front anti-clockwise rotation
		‘h’: Back clockwise rotation
		‘H’ (Shift + ‘h’): Back anti-clockwise rotation


		‘b’: Right clockwise rotation
		‘B’ (Shift + ‘b’): Right anti- clockwise rotation
		‘n’: Left clockwise rotation
